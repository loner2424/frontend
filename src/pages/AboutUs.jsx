<p className='justify-center text-xl my-4 font-bold mx-2 md:mx-14'>A Passionate Journey</p>

<p className='text-justify mx-2 md:mx-14'> Hailing from the vibrant city of Bhopal, my journey into the world of technology began with a deep-seated curiosity and an unwavering love for coding. As a final year student at Manipal University Jaipur, specializing in Computer and Communication, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the dynamic realm of web development.</p>
